# Godot Tweening Cheat Sheet

Modified and improved Godot project to render the [Godot Tweening Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/frqzup/godot_tweening_cheat_sheet/). Modifications were made so that people can format the charts at run-time to see the result in realtime (the logic is currently implemented with brute-force approach. It would be awesome if you could make a pull request if you have better or more elegant way of doing this). The title and attribution watermark are not included in this version. The repo is under MIT license, in my "not a lawyer" understanding, that means you can do whatever you want with this. It would be nice if you can attribute the work to `Wandom Pewlin` or link to this repo somehow.
